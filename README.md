# Folder-to-Text Converter

A Node.js utility to convert folder structures to text files and vice versa. This tool helps you:

- Archive folder structures in a human-readable text format
- Restore folder structures from these text files
- Transfer project structures between systems or environments

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (v14.0.0 or higher recommended)
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Create two directories next to the script:
   - `Project_Folder`: Place folders to convert here
   - `Text_Conversion`: This is where text files will be stored

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (Recommended)

Simply run the script without any arguments:

```
node convert.js
```

This will:

1. **First**, convert any text files found in the `Text_Conversion` directory back to folders in the `Project_Folder` directory
2. **Then**, convert any folders in the `Project_Folder` directory to text files in the `Text_Conversion` directory

### Manual Mode (For Custom Paths)

#### Converting a Text File Back to a Folder Structure

```
node convert.js --to-folder ./Text_Conversion/my-project.txt ./restored-project
```

## How It Works

### Folder-to-Text Conversion

1. The script traverses the folder structure recursively
2. For each folder and file, it adds appropriate markers to the output text file
3. Binary files are detected and appropriately marked
4. Large files are handled using streaming to prevent memory issues

### Text-to-Folder Reconstruction

1. The script parses the text file to extract folder and file information
2. It recreates the folder structure and files with their contents
3. Large files are processed efficiently using streaming

## Tips

- The script automatically excludes `node_modules` directories to avoid processing large dependency trees
- Files over 10MB are processed using streaming to prevent memory issues
- Binary files are properly handled during both conversion and reconstruction

## Example Structure

Your directory structure should look like:

```
Folder-to-Text-Converter/
├── convert.js
├── Project_Folder/
│   └── [your folders to convert]
└── Text_Conversion/
    └── [converted text files]
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have proper permissions to read/write in the directories
- For large projects, the conversion process may take some time

## Features

- Simple drag-and-drop workflow - just put folders in "Project_Folder" and run the script
- Converts all folders in the Project_Folder automatically
- Preserves all file contents and folder hierarchy
- Handles binary files appropriately (marked but not converted)
- Detailed progress reporting
- Automatically excludes `node_modules` directories

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script
2. Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x convert.js`
3. Ensure "Project_Folder" and "Text_Conversion" directories exist next to the script

## Output Format

The text file has a simple format:

```
=== FOLDER STRUCTURE EXPORT ===
Source: /path/to/original/folder
Generated: 2023-06-05T19:38:17.090Z
Excluded directories: node_modules

=== BEGIN CONTENT ===
--- FOLDER: folder-name ---
--- FILE: folder-name/file.txt ---
Content of file.txt
goes here with
all lines preserved
--- END FILE ---
--- FOLDER: folder-name/subfolder ---
--- FILE: folder-name/subfolder/another-file.js ---
console.log('Hello World');
--- END FILE ---
=== END CONTENT ===
```

## Progress Reporting

The script shows detailed progress information during conversion:

- Number of files and folders processed
- Total data size
- Time taken
- Number of directories excluded

For large folder structures, the script will show periodic updates and handle memory efficiently.

## Exclusions

By default, the script excludes the following directories from conversion:

- `node_modules` (to avoid processing potentially large dependency trees)

## Limitations

- Binary files are detected but not converted (marked as `[BINARY]`)
- Large files (>10MB) are skipped and marked as `[LARGE FILE]`
- Permissions and file metadata are not preserved
